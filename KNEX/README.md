# K'NEX-smartphone-holder-desk
A smartphone holder for a desk using [K'NEX](https://www.knex.com).

A fun project just to show what can be simply build using K'NEX parts.
Rather handy when developing apps or monitoring homme automation or watching newsfeeds and the likes.

### K'NEX Parts
Created this solution adhoc with some spare K'NEX parts.
Look at the pictures for parts used.
