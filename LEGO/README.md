# LEGO-smartphone-holder-desk
A smartphone holder for a desk using LEGO(R)Technic.

A fun project just to show what can be simply build using LEGO Technic parts.
Rather handy when developing apps or monitoring homme automation or watching newsfeeds and the likes.

### LEGO Parts
Created this solution adhoc with some spare LEGO(R)Technic parts.
Look at the pictures for parts used.
